# Gambit-Headers
Headers for custom code in Splatoon 1

The repo is still a heavy work-in-progress; expect incomplete (and possibly wrong) documentation.

Class and function names are largely conjectural based off context, leftover strings in the executable and symbol names found in Splatoon 2.

Symbol maps and an example project will be coming soon.
